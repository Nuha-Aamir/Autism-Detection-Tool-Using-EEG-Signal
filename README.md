This is my Final Year Project (FYP) — an AI-based system designed to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

🔍 Key Features:
Preprocessing and analysis of raw EEG data
Feature extraction using signal processing techniques
Machine learning models for classification
Visualization of EEG patterns related to ASD indicators

🎯 Goal:
To support early diagnosis of Autism through non-invasive, brain-signal-based analysis — providing a step forward in healthcare and AI integration

⚠️ Note: This project is in progress — updates and improvements will be pushed regularly.
